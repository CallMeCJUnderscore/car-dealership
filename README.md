# Car-Dealership
This is the end-of-week workshop for Week 5 of the Fall 2023 Course of the Pluralsight Learn-to-Code Academy.

## Details
This project contains a CLI application made to support a hypothetical car dealership, all focused around interfacing with a .csv file. The .csv contains both info about the dealership as well as the many vehicles it has on sale. Any time the inventory is changed via adding or removing a vehicle, it is reflected in both the application and the csv file it is made to work with.

## What's so good about it?
I would argue that the most interesting part about the program is the structure of the program itself, as it is separated into no less than 5 distinct classes. Several classes have Has-A relationships with each other, and cohesion is generally quite high.

## Screenshots
Below are various screenshots of the program as it runs
